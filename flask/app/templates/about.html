        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>Students submit their code through a simple web interface. The Auto-Grader then compiles and runs the code in a secure, isolated environment, comparing the output against expected results. Scores and feedback are provided directly through the web interface, offering a seamless experience for both students and instructors.</p>
